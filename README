Wool Plus - Dye'ing made fun

Woolplus is a simple easy to use mod that lets you dye wool in a more interesting manner than crafting. 
Players holding wool can dye wool simply by right clicking. 
You can mix colors just like the crafting combinations and there are additional combinations. 
You can even make brown wool. 
If you want to reset the dyed wools back to something like white, just apply white enough times to *bleach* it. 
Black for example, will dye everything black.

color combinations:

 * order-dependent:
 * white + color = color
 * black + white = gray
 * brown + white = light gray
 * gray + white = light gray
 * purple + white = magenta ?
 * teal + white = white (? or change to light blue ?)
 * blue + white = light blue
 * green + white = light green
 * red + white = pink
 * light color + white = white
 * enything else given white not specified above becomes white
 * pink + red = red
 * light blue + blue = blue
 * light gray + gray = gray
 * light green + green = green
 * magenta + purple = purple
 * pink + magenta = magenta
 * 
 *
 * any order:
 * color + black = black
 * gray + gray = black
 * light gray + light gray = gray
 * pink + pink = red
 * magenta + magenta = purple
 * light blue + light blue = blue
 * light green + light green = green
 * orange + purple = red
 * cyan + purple = blue
 * yellow + blue = green
 * yellow + red = orange
 * red + white = pink
 * red + blue = purple
 * blue + green = teal
 * purple + pink = magenta
 * yellow + green = lime
 * gray + light color = brown
 * light gray + dark color = brown
 *
 * and every comb not on this list becomes brown:
 * blue + purple
 * blue + magenta
 * purple + red
 * purple + pink
